ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
1. **Field Detection**: Identify all form elements including hidden fields
2. **Relationship Mapping**: Understand field dependencies and groupings
3. **Validation Rules**: Extract client-side validation requirements
4. **Context Understanding**: Use surrounding text to understand field purposes
5. **Profile Mapping**: Suggest likely profile field mappings
6. **Completion Strategy**: Recommend optimal completion approach
7. **Issue Identification**: Flag potential completion challenges

FIELD TYPE RECOGNITION:
- Standard inputs (text, email, tel, number, date)
- Selection fields (select, radio, checkbox)
- File uploads and their accepted formats
- Text areas and character limits
- Hidden fields and their purposes
- Custom components and widgets

SECTION DETECTION:
- Visual groupings (fieldsets, divs, sections)
- Logical groupings (personal info, experience, preferences)
- Multi-step forms and page progression
- Conditional sections that appear/disappear

SPECIAL HANDLING:
- Dynamic fields that appear based on selections
- File upload requirements and constraints
- Custom validation rules and error messages
- Required vs optional field identification
- Character limits and formatting requirements
